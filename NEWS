** 3.1.508
# 01.12.2010
* Button/menu item added to Draw3 for positioning cursor at last available 
data.
* Fixes in Draw3 GUI for editing draw/parameters.
* Extractor can now extract also 10-seconds probes.
* Lua parameter optimizer updated to process parameters which reference 
itself.
* Small fixes in data handling by Draw3 - 10 seconds combined probes, few 
other corner cases.

** 3.1.500
# 01.11.2010
* Draw3 documentation updated with description of treenode element.
* New boruta sub-driver for Metronic FP210, fixes in Modbus and ZET 
sub-driver.
* Draw3 fixes: propagating change of user-defined parameter name, speeding 
up closing of program, fixes in editing user defined params, draws from 
user defined sets are not shown in search windows, small improvements in 
database engine fixing some rarely occurring bugs.
* Szarp synchronizer - added option to manually set prefix of database to 
synchronize.

** 3.1.442
# 01.10.2010
* A support from "PCD" variant of SBUS protcol was added to sbusdmn.
* A lot of fixes and improvements was introduced to meta-daemon boruta,
daemon support for zet and modbus rtu protcols were tested and deployed.
* Draw3 can now be configured to display draw sets arranged in hierarchical
tree-like structure. This feature will be especially useful for users
that prefer to navigate trough draw sets using mouse than searching
with keyboard. It also allows to categorize sets in more explicit way.
* A pair of tools was added that convert ipk configuration from/to 
cvs format. It is sometimes more convenient to edit configuration
in tabular form.
* And usual assortment of small fixes and improvements.

** 3.1.439
# 01.09.2010
* Fixes in generating XML config for LUA formulas using IPK library.
* szbwriter by default does not add unknown parameters to configuration, that 
prevents from breaking configuration by incorrect calls to szbwriter.
* Fixed few draw3 crashes under Windows on non-standard configuration/bases.
* Fixed incorrect draw3 behaviour when to many draws are added to user set.
* More flexible filler behaviour - default database writing comment can be 
overwritten using FILLER_COMMAND environment variable.
* Added modbus protocol support for boruta meta-daemon.
* More intuitive draw3 behaviour on PgUp/PgDown key press.
* Few other small fixes.

** 3.1.438
# 01.08.2010
* New universal device driver - "boruta" meta-daemon, with possibility to easily
add different protocol implementations and support for multiple devices.
* Support for 10-seconds probes in extractor and szbwriter programs.
* 10-seconds probes are on by default.
* New options for szrsync and szbpush to allow limiting transfer speed.
* Draw3 fixes, including more intuitive behaviour on PgUp/PgDown.
* Small fixes in raporter and synchronizer applications.

** 3.1.432
# 01.07.2010
* Support for 10-second probes in szbase and draw3 application was completed.
* New 'latest data following mode' was added to draw3, when working in this mode 
draw3 positions graph in such a way that always latest data is visible.
* There are some improvements and bug fixes in XYZ graph drawing.
* mbdmn: daemon now supports unit addresses from 1 up to 255
* mbdmn: improved logging

** 3.1.426
# 01.06.2010
* 10-second probes archivisation process is integrated into SZARP startup scripts and removes
outdated files from cache.
* draw3 support for displaying 10-second probes is under developement, along with necessary fixes
and improvements in probes server.

* New driver for energy meteres usingg IEC 62056-21 protocol.
* szast program for controling ZET/Sterkom PLCs can now talk over TCP/IP connection.

** 3.1.423
# 04.05.2010
* New type of graphs was added to draw3 application - XYZ graphs. These 3 dimensional graphs
can be used to analyze dependecies among values of 3 parameters from any period of time.
This feature enhances even further SZARPs historical data analysis abilities. XYZ graphs can also
be quite pleasant aesthetically.
* There was significant progress in development of 10-second archivisation/presentation
infrastucture.
* SZARP device drivers (daemons) have now generic mechanism for reporting protocols that they
support, making information on devices supported by SZARP more easily available.
* New pair of applications were added to SZARP: setdmn accompanied by GUI client - setter. These
apps sole purpose is to allow users to set parameters values over network.
* SZARP source code repository has been migrated to git.
* number of smaller fixes/improvements

** 3.1.385
# 01.04.2010

* New features in draw3 program: editing currect draws' set as defined set, 
importing and exporting draws' sets, showing "documentation" of user-defined
parameters, checking if newer draw3 version is already installed.
* Optimiser for Lua parameters - if parameter is enough "simple", it is parsed
by internal SZARP engine and calculated without need of evaluating it by Lua 
interpreter. The effect is, that Lua optimised parameters are event faster then
traditional RPN parameters.
* Parcook daemon correctly calculates average values for "combined" parameters, 
without errors resulting from separate averaging of less- and more- significant
words.
* Fixes in new Modbus daemon serial mode transmit timeouts handling.
* Many bug fixes.

** 3.1.332
# 02.03.2010

* Synchronizer protocol was extended to more efficiently handle most common
case of adding new data to szbase file.
* Draw3 printing support was improved.
* LUA parameters execution errors are now properly caught.
* Daemon for reading values from tensometric scale has been added to SZARP.
* Development of viszio application has been completed.
* Szast application has been enhanced, it can now fetch reports from 
regulators.
* A minor fix in raporter3 application: parameter selection persists values 
list refresh.

** 3.1.287
# 02.02.2010

* ddespy has been rewritten and ddedmn improved. Thanks to these changes
fetching data from DDE servers is much faster now.
* The way parcook launches line daemons has been changed, now they are started
directly be execve, not as it used to be - through /bin/sh -c.
* New utility "szbmod" has been added. Szbmod allows for fast modification
of szbase historical data through LUA scripts.
* Szbase cache mechanism was extended, now much more values are stored in cache 
thus improving defined parameters drawing speed.
* Work on new major feature - trends plotting of 10 seconds probes - has been started.
The first phase of this task - an daemon storing these probes has been written and now
is tested at one of heating plants.
* raporter3 has now complete documentation.

** 3.1.254
# 31.12.2009

bugs, most of them was hopefully resolved. Separate thread for saving cache to 
disk was removed. Correct icons where added to multiple dialog windows within 
application.
* Parameter value on dark blue background in draw3 program was pourly visible
on some displays, background color is a little lighter now.
* Added new 'viszio' application for displaying values of selected parameters
directly on screen. Viszio is still 'work in progress'.

missing values are replaced with averages computed from surrounding values.
* Fix in HTML links generated by paramd program.
* Added 'M' function for fast filtering too big values in defined parameters.
* New universal driver for Modbus protocol, able to handle RTU/ASCII encoding
and both serial and TCP connections.

* ipkedit: update, min max ranges and color attributes can be changed,
also documentation of ipkedit was updated
* raporter3: program was expaned - user report templates are now saved
automaticaly and are available directly from menu - this is more compliant
with draw3 behaviour, lots of other small fixes and improvements, code review.
* reporter3: numerous fixes.
* raporter3: initial version of documentation is available.

** 3.1.1
# 24.07.2009

Major version change: 3.0 => 3.1.

The main reason to increase version number was moving repository to
SoureForge. It was an opportunity to remove some obsolete files and any
dependencies on non-GPL code. Project home page moved to http://www.szarp.org.
