that prefer to navigate trough draw sets using mouse than searching
with keyboard. It also allows to categorize sets in more explicit way.

be quite pleasant aesthetically.
* There was significant progress in development of 10-second archivisation/presentation
infrastucture.
* SZARP device drivers (daemons) have now generic mechanism for reporting protocols that they
support, making information on devices supported by SZARP more easily available.

apps sole purpose is to allow users to set parameters values over network.
* SZARP source code repository has been migrated to git.
* number of smaller fixes/improvements

** 3.1.385
# 01.04.2010

* New features in draw3 program: editing currect draws' set as defined set, 
importing and exporting draws' sets, showing "documentation" of user-defined
parameters, checking if newer draw3 version is already installed.
* Optimiser for Lua parameters - if parameter is enough "simple", it is parsed
by internal SZARP engine and calculated without need of evaluating it by Lua 
interpreter. The effect is, that Lua optimised parameters are event faster then
traditional RPN parameters.
* Parcook daemon correctly calculates average values for "combined" parameters, 
without errors resulting from separate averaging of less- and more- significant
words.
* Fixes in new Modbus daemon serial mode transmit timeouts handling.
* Many bug fixes.

regulators.
* A minor fix in raporter3 application: parameter selection persists values 
list refresh.

** 3.1.287
# 02.02.2010

* ddespy has been rewritten and ddedmn improved. Thanks to these changes
fetching data from DDE servers is much faster now.
* The way parcook launches line daemons has been changed, now they are started
directly be execve, not as it used to be - through /bin/sh -c.
* New utility "szbmod" has been added. Szbmod allows for fast modification
of szbase historical data through LUA scripts.
* Szbase cache mechanism was extended, now much more values are stored in cache 
thus improving defined parameters drawing speed.
* Work on new major feature - trends plotting of 10 seconds probes - has been started.
The first phase of this task - an daemon storing these probes has been written and now
is tested at one of heating plants.
* raporter3 has now complete documentation.

** 3.1.254
# 31.12.2009

bugs, most of them was hopefully resolved. Separate thread for saving cache to 
disk was removed. Correct icons where added to multiple dialog windows within 
application.
* Parameter value on dark blue background in draw3 program was pourly visible
on some displays, background color is a little lighter now.
* Added new 'viszio' application for displaying values of selected parameters
directly on screen. Viszio is still 'work in progress'.

missing values are replaced with averages computed from surrounding values.
* Fix in HTML links generated by paramd program.
* Added 'M' function for fast filtering too big values in defined parameters.

* ipkedit: update, min max ranges and color attributes can be changed,
also documentation of ipkedit was updated
* raporter3: program was expaned - user report templates are now saved
automaticaly and are available directly from menu - this is more compliant
with draw3 behaviour, lots of other small fixes and improvements, code review.
* reporter3: numerous fixes.
* raporter3: initial version of documentation is available.

** 3.1.1
# 24.07.2009

Major version change: 3.0 => 3.1.

The main reason to increase version number was moving repository to
SoureForge. It was an opportunity to remove some obsolete files and any
dependencies on non-GPL code. Project home page moved to http://www.szarp.org.
