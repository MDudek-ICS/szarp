** 3.1.385
# 01.04.2010

* New features in draw3 program: editing currect draws' set as defined set, 
importing and exporting draws' sets, showing "documentation" of user-defined
parameters, checking if newer draw3 version is already installed.
* Optimiser for Lua parameters - if parameter is enough "simple", it is parsed
by internal SZARP engine and calculated without need of evaluating it by Lua 
interpreter. The effect is, that Lua optimised parameters are event faster then
traditional RPN parameters.
* Parcook daemon correctly calculates average values for "combined" parameters, 
without errors resulting from separate averaging of less- and more- significant
words.
* Fixes in new Modbus daemon serial mode transmit timeouts handling.
* Many bug fixes.

** 3.1.332
# 02.03.2010

* Synchronizer protocol was extended to more efficiently handle most common
case of adding new data to szbase file.
* Draw3 printing support was improved.
* LUA parameters execution errors are now properly caught.
* Daemon for reading values from tensometric scale has been added to SZARP.
* Development of viszio application has been completed.
* Szast application has been enhanced, it can now fetch reports from 
regulators.
* A minor fix in raporter3 application: parameter selection persists values 
list refresh.

** 3.1.287
# 02.02.2010

* ddespy has been rewritten and ddedmn improved. Thanks to these changes
fetching data from DDE servers is much faster now.
* The way parcook launches line daemons has been changed, now they are started
directly be execve, not as it used to be - through /bin/sh -c.
* New utility "szbmod" has been added. Szbmod allows for fast modification
of szbase historical data through LUA scripts.
* Szbase cache mechanism was extended, now much more values are stored in cache 
thus improving defined parameters drawing speed.
* Work on new major feature - trends plotting of 10 seconds probes - has been started.
The first phase of this task - an daemon storing these probes has been written and now
is tested at one of heating plants.
* raporter3 has now complete documentation.

** 3.1.254
# 31.12.2009

* Major code refactoring of draw3 program, changes introduced quite a few 
bugs, most of them was hopefully resolved. Separate thread for saving cache to 
disk was removed. Correct icons where added to multiple dialog windows within 
application.
* Parameter value on dark blue background in draw3 program was pourly visible
on some displays, background color is a little lighter now.
* Added new 'viszio' application for displaying values of selected parameters
directly on screen. Viszio is still 'work in progress'.
* Added szbndremover - tool for "removal" of no-data holes in database - 
missing values are replaced with averages computed from surrounding values.
* Fix in HTML links generated by paramd program.
* Added 'M' function for fast filtering too big values in defined parameters.
* New universal driver for Modbus protocol, able to handle RTU/ASCII encoding
and both serial and TCP connections.

** 3.1.206
# 31.11.2009

* There is a new apt repository branch avaiable in szarp.org repository
- 'karmic', containing version of szarp compiled for 'karmic koala' Ubuntu
distribution.
* draw3: it now possible to set margins, orientation and page size of printouts
* Buggy wxSingleInstanceChecker (class resposible for detecting if
other copy of application is running) replaced with our own implementation.
* mbrtudmn: slave mode was fixed
* ipkedit: update, min max ranges and color attributes can be changed,
also documentation of ipkedit was updated
* raporter3: program was expaned - user report templates are now saved
automaticaly and are available directly from menu - this is more compliant
with draw3 behaviour, lots of other small fixes and improvements, code review.
* reporter3: numerous fixes.
* raporter3: initial version of documentation is available.
* Help fix: searching in documentation no longer causes applications to crash.

** 3.1.163
# 31.10.2009

* Added scripts for fetching weather forecast from meteoprog.ua website.
* Draw3 fixes: cursor positioning in "antialiasing mode", race condition in remarks server address resolution, data averaging on x/y graphs.
* Draw3: "antialiasing mode" is now default under both Linux and Windows.
* Sender fix: it now ignores empty <send/> elements in configuration.
* Fixes for latest mingw32, "critical" lintian bugs fixed.
* Refreshing of isledit (Inkscape plugin for creating SVG visualisation schemas), it now works under both Linux and Windows.
* More examples of ISL documents added.
* All applications have now icons under Windows.

** 3.1.130
# 30.09.2009

* Bug fixes and improvements in kontroler3 program, added sound playing on alarm.
* Multiple bug fixes in Modbus RTU driver (timing synchronization); added support for BCD encoded values.
* Added support for different word order in float values in Modbus TCP driver.
* Completed "antialiasing style" draws displaying; it is more suitable for high resolution displays; it also should have less memory usage, but can be slower on some computers.
* New driver for Aquameter Calec MCP-300 heatmeter.
* Added RPN 'm' function for fast filtering of values outside meaningful range.
* Bug fixes in draw3: X/Y drawing, draws colors assigments, opening new window, drawing new points while filter > 0, info about currently selected graphs style.
* Multiple build fixes for newest Debian unstable.

** 3.1.97
# 31.08.2009

* Fixed presentation of 32-bits ("combined") values in paramd/reporter program.
* Driver for Modbus TCP can ask for more then 128 registers.
* Disabled potentially harmfull SZARP Command Center option to change data directory under Linux.
* No-data string in Reporter is localized now.
* Fixes in Modbus RTU driver serial port handling, configuration parsing, time synchronization.
* User can select databases that are not shown in SZARP Command Center, Extractor and Draw programs.
* Improvements in Draw3 remarks handling - remarks server address can be resolved using DNS, default user and password is taken from SZARP Synchronizer, basic support for agregated configurations.
* Added documentation of Draw3 'remarks' feature.
* Basic administration of remarks server users can now be handled with ssweb.
* Fixed permission problem with registering new users key by SZARP Synchronization Server.
* Experimental surrport for drawing using wxGraphicsContext in Draw3 program.
* Fixed dependencies of Filler program.
* SZARP Automatic Updater uses SourceForge.net RSS feeds to obtain correct version number of SZARP.
* Updated 'eksploatacja' documentation.

** 3.1.53
# 03.08.2009

* New remarks functionality in draw3 program. Remarks are short text comments that are bound to some draws' set (or all data) at particular time. They can describe some event (for example device failure) or contain information for operators. Remarks are stored on central server and distributed using RPC-like protocol to all users viewing installation data. Users with appropiate privilges can add and edit remarks.
* init.d scripts for terminals are now compliant with version 3 mechanism for tranmission of current parameter values.
* Fix in ekstraktor3 Open Document Spreadsheet format handling, export to ODS should work on both Linux and Windows.
* Fixes in creating user-defined reports in reporter3 program.
* Windows build uses now faster Lua version - with just-in-time compiler.
* New build system (for Linux ans Windows) using source repository from SourceForge.net, Debian repository has been moved to http://szarp.org. Stable and unstable versions of Debian packages have now binary dependencies appropiate for release. 

** 3.1.1
# 24.07.2009

Major version change: 3.0 => 3.1.

The main reason to increase version number was moving repository to
SoureForge. It was an opportunity to remove some obsolete files and any
dependencies on non-GPL code. Project home page moved to http://www.szarp.org.
