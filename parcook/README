All source files int this directory with base name ending in 'dmn' are SZARP
device drivers (called 'SZARP daemons') source files. This file describes
specification classes for SZARP daemons and format of daemon description.

** SZARP daemons (drivers) specifications classes. **

Each SZARP daemon conforms two one of specification classes:

1. None - daemon does not conform to any higher specification class. For 
example it can access IPC segments on its own.

2. Daemon uses libSzarp to access SZARP IPC mechanisms, but does not conforms
to any higher specification class, for example it reads configuration from
SZARP 2.1 format configuraion files.

3. Daemon conforms to class 2 and reads configuration entirely from params.xml.

4. Daemon conforms to class 3 and uses DaemonConfig class for reading 
configuration and IPCHandler to access SZARP IPC mechanisms.

** SZARP daemons description format. **

Description is placed in comment in main daemon source file. It contains 
commands starting with '@' sign and text content. Text content ends at
next command. Available commands:

@description_start - marks start of description block
@description_end - marks end of description block
@class <number> - specification class that daemon conforms to
@protocol - protocol name/description that daemon uses to communicate with device
@devices - description of served devices
@comment - aditional comment on daemon
@config - description of daemon configuration
@config_example - example of daemon configuration

Commands can have '.<language code>' suffix, for content in other language, for 
example '@comment.pl' marks start of daemon comment in Polish. See setdmn.cc for
example of specification. Text content encoding should be ISO-8859-2. config_example
section is generated as CDATA, in other sections you can use docbook tags. Empty
lines are replaces with </para>\n<para>.
