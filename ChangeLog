2010-09-27	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* parcook/boruta*: more boruta imprements
	* parcook/boruta*: bunch of fixes for boruta, modbus
	rtu in client mode seems to be working
	* parccok/sbusdmn.cc: fixes for PCD mode, driver now 
	correctly gathers data in Legionowo
2010-09-24	Pawel Palucha <pawel@newterm.pl>
	* script/{csv2p,p2csv}.py: scripts for importing/exporting IPK
	configuration to/from CSV format - sometimes it's easier to edit
	params.xml in spreadsheet format.
2010-09-24	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* wx/draw3: fix a bug introduced together with support 
	for draws sets' trees...
2010-09-23	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* parcook/sbusdmn.cc: added support for PCD variant of SBUS protocol
2010-09-20	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* wx/draw3: new command line switch '-e' for draw3, when this
	switch is given on command line toghether with an url
	and if draw3 is already running, this url will be opened
	by currently active panel of running draw3 instance and
	parent frame of this panel will be raised
	* parcook/boruta*: more fixes
2010-09-14	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2, wx/draw3: draws' sets can be arranged in hierarchical 
	tree structure
2010-09-07	Pawe³ Pa³ucha <pawel@newterm.pl>
	* utils/modem_pooler.sh: additional sleep before running rsync (fixes
	some issues).
2010-08-19	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2/ipk/tparam.cc: generation of XML node for lua
	parameter did not set lua_formula attribute properly - saveXML
	generated improper params.xml
	* meaner3/utils/szbwriter.cc: Szbwriter has a cool feature:
	when a param name is encountered that is not present in configuration,
	szbwriter updates configuration by adding new param with this name.
	That is very nice, but in majority of cases (I believe) param name that
	in not present in config really means that somebody misspelled
	its name and because szbwriter uses ipk to modify params.xml,
	new configuration is stripped of all elements from extra namespaces,
	what is really irritating. So, by now unknown parameters are ignored,
	old behaviour might be activated by giving a -n switch on the command line.
2010-08-17	Krzysztof Galazka <kg@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* utils/conf-put.sh: replaced debug code with real svn call
2010-08-17	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase/realdatablock.cc: fixed incorrect behaviour
	under msw when there is no 'Status/Meaner3/program uruchomiony' param
	for a given base
	* meaner3/utils/szbwriter.cc: fix in params switching
2010-08-09	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* wx/draw3: fixed a bug in a boundary case when 
	there were more than MAX_DRAWS_COUNT draws added into user set
	* wx/filler: default command (/opt/szarp/bin/szbwriter) that filler
	executes in order to store data in database, can by overridden 
	by environment variable FILLER_COMMAND
	* parcook/boruta: progress, modbus protocol support added
2010-08-02	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase/szbsearch.cc: fix in setting search
	boundaries in quite rare case when both start and end
	search time is specified
	* parcook/boruta*: progress, some code simplification
	* wx/draw3: more intuitive behaviour on PgUp/PgDown
	key press
2010-07-29	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* debian/control: szarp-daemons depends on python-twisted now
	* meaner3/tprober.cc: creates cachedir if not exists
	* utils/probes_server/probes_server.tac: there is no twisted.python.log 
	in version of twisted from lenny, but we can live with that
2010-07-28	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* debian/szarp-base.postinst: szarp-base no longer depends
	on vim, but script install_vim returned non-zero exit status if there
	was no vim - szarp-base was uninstallable on vimless systems
2010-07-28	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* parcook/boruta_zet.cc: compiles under debian stable
	* parcook/tcpdmn.cc: forgotten commit - small fixes
	* maener3/tsaveparam.cc: removed redundant check
	of file size
	* maener3/utils/szbwriter.cc: fixes
2010-07-28	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* meaner3: szbwriter fixes
	* utils/probes_server: one more off-by-one error
	in seraching left
2010-07-27	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* wx/common: function reading addresses of probes servers
	moved from draw3 to common	
	* wx/ekstrator3: fix in commandline parsing
	* wx/ekstrator3: support for 10 seconds probes, with two limitations
	compared to draw: ekstartor3 ignores any szbase errors, so in case of any
	connection problems, user just gets no-datas and no information
	about their cause; unlike in draw3, there is no GUI for configuring servers'
	addreses by a user, ekstartor3 only knows how to read probes addresses
	from szarp.cfg /those limitations are quite easy to remove, but
	still require some work/
	* resources/SZARP_IN_CFG: default configuration of probes
	server
	* resources/parstart_cfg_TEMPLATE: prober and probes server
	started by default
2010-07-27	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* meaner3: szbwriter support for 10 second probes	
2010-07-26	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* parcook/borutadmn: boruta daemon, thin meta-daemon
	which does not implement any specific protocol
	but is intended as a generic platform for running particular
	protocols implementations, boruta offers a few adventages
	over traditional daemons: any number of devices working
	as servers or clients over serial line or tcp using any
	implemented protocol can be communicated from within one
	running process; boruta's code contains some helper functions
	for parsing params.xml and setting up connections parameters;
	boruta takes care of mundane tasks of managing connections ideally
	allowing protocol implementor to focus only on protcol details,
	leaving rest of the stuff to boruta's code
	* parcook/botura_zet.cc: zet protocol implementation for boruta
2010-07-22	Pawel Palucha <pawel@newterm.pl>
	* resources/parstart_TEMPLATE: init script returns 0 (success) 
	if szarp.cfg was not found; allows proper (de)installation
	of szarp packages when changing configuration prefix.
2010-07-14	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/sync: added functionality similar to what
	is already present in draw3: in debug mode liblog output
	is directed to a file; improved logging; fixed error
	in case of premature connection termination from 
	server - until now timeout error were reported;
	command line parsing adapted from old, unsupported
	way to 'new', 'better' and supported ;) API
	* wx/raporter3/raportededit.cc: wxMSW bug workaround:
	under MSWin, passing validator to wxTextCtrl constutor
	leads to EVT_TEXT being emitted from within control's
	construtor - much too early for a parent window object
	to be in any sane state...
2010-07-12	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* utlis/{szrsync,szbpush}: scrpits supports new 
	command line option: -b, that allows to specify maximum
	data transfer speed
2010-07-08	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* libSzarp2/include/szbase/lua_syntax_fusion_adapt.h: code 
	adopting lua grammar structs to fusion sequences kicked out
	to separate header
	* libSzarp2/szbase/lua_parser.cc: added comments 
	* libSzarp2/szbase/luacalculate.cc: fix of a stupid bug when
	max of two values was taken instead of min and vice versa
	* libSzarp2/szbase/realdatablock.cc: fix a bug that, for mysterious
	and unknown reasons, only hit windows version of szarp
	* parcook/sbusdmn.cc: fixes
	* version: windows version bump
	* wx/draw3/drawapp.cpp: under windows debug log goes to user home directory
	* wx/draw3/luapextract.cpp: code for extracting strings from lua formulas
	now more generic (actually grammar-agnostic) and half as long as initial version
2010-07-02	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase: proper refresh of lua optimized datablock
	for params that do not refer to any parameters
	* wx/sync: do not start automatic synchronization
	immidiately after program startup - users from Szombierki
	claim that sometimes when program in run by windows startup
	scripts, synchronization hangs, and program needs to be restarted.
	Unfortunately I was not able to reprocude incorrect ssc behaviour,
	since the workaround. I have also updated libcares in a windows build,
	as it a first thing that does any network I/O.
2010-07-01	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase: cache is poisoned before 
	refresh operation; removed assert checking if
	cache file modification time is not later than
	now, suprisingly, it is something that can happen
	unser msw
	* libSzarp2/szbase: fixed an old, obsurce bug in
	calculating numer of values in drawdefinable param block, bug
	was triggerd for certain months by formulas that
	referred to parameters with values reaching into the future
	* wx/draw3: percentage of probes in summary window
	not shown only if 100% of probes are present
	* wx/draw3: fixed crash ocurring when user chose 
	'edit as new definable' menu item and then edited
	a user defined param from such freshly created set
2010-06-30	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3/xyzgraph.cpp: axes description fix
2010-06-29	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase/lua_parser.cc: under boost version
	that we use for arm, qi::phrase_parse take non-const
	reference to parser and skip parser objects
2010-06-25	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase: instead of canceling operation on a socket when 
	timeout occurs, we just close the socket - under MS Windows XP cancelling 
	asio operations on a socket does not work (it's even worse
	than 'not working' - it causes draw3 to crash)
2010-06-23	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase: fix in deadline timer handling 
2010-06-17	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase: fixes, improvments resulting from yet another 10
	seconds' probes testing session
2010-06-16	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase: fix in searching/computing values of lua parameters
	that are handled the 'old way'
	* wx/draw3: current period radiobox from main menu was not properly
	updated upon period change - fixed
2010-06-16	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* utils/probes_server/*: search left fix, more debug.
	* utils/probes_server/*: last probe number fix, more debug.
2010-06-15	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* parcook/mbdmn.cc: daemons logs all requests to a units' ids
	that are not present in its configuration + unit id given
	in ipk can be overriden by attribute id from modbus namespace,
	id attribute from this extra namespace daemon treats
	as a numeric value, as opposed to id from ipk namespace
	which is a single char
2010-06-14	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* parcook/prodmn.cc: daemon for getting data from PRO2000 proxy
2010-06-14	Krzysztof Galazka <kg@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* parcook/mbdmn.cc: logging fixes for easier grep usage
2010-06-14	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3: one more bug fixed...
2010-06-13	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3: there was a bug in color assignemnt in 3D graph - 
	wrong color values were assigned to 2 points of each traingle
	composing graph, what resulted in 'edgy' and kind of odd looking
	graphs, now things look much smoother and what's most important it is
	easier to make sense of data presented; new 'raw' drawing mode added
	to 3D graphs, where no triangulation is prefermed, just individual
	points are painted (space bar switches between graph modes)
2010-06-12	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* libsSzarp2: bug in getting 10-seconds probes killed,
	introduced timeouts for search operations
	* wx/draw3: fixed stupid bug in setting current time
	* wx/draw3: addresses of prebes servers may specified in szarp.cfg
	* wx/draw3: configurations' titles in dialog for setting addresses
	of probes servers are sorted by prefix
	* wx/draw3: only uniqe errors are displayed in error frame,
	also added translation of error messages that originate from szbase 
	* wx/draw3: 10 minutes -> 30 minutes period
	* wx/draw3: better labelling of time axis for 30 minutes period
2010-06-09	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3: some bugs killed
	* resources/documentation/new/draw3/darw3.sgml: added short description of
	differences between linear correlation and rank correlation
2010-06-07	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3: latest data following mode - in this mode, draw3,
	while performing automatic data refresh, does a search for latest
	value of current param and then positions cursor at this latest
	value	
	* /: latest changes compile on windows
2010-06-06	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase: more logging, fix in setting number of 
	fixed 10-seconds probes for RPN params
	* utils/probes_server/szbcache.py: few small fixes
	* wx/common/datechooser.*: also allows to set second
	in date being choosen
	* wx/draw3: translation of new GUI elements, date in xygraph,
	xyzgraph, stat dialog can be set with 10 seconds resolution
2010-06-04	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* /: support for 10-seconds values that mostly works - there
	are sill some bugs lurking here and there and only draw3 knows
	how to use them
2010-06-01	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* utils/probes_server/*: fixes in search request handling.
2010-05-31 	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3: empty erase event hadler added to xyz graph widget,
	this event handler eliminates flickering at widget's repainting
	* wx/szast: szast can talk over tcp/ip connection
2010-05-28	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* utils/probes_server/*: added RANGE request for checking global
	first/last probe available.
2010-05-25	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* utils/probes_server/*: added info about first/last data in response
	for search request.
	* utils/conf-*.sh: added -p/--port option for setting svn+ssh port number.
2010-05-24	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* utils/nagios/sn-fam.py: ignoring temporary OSError exceptions that
	can happen when working on NFS-mounted data.
2010-05-21	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3/drawfrm: under lenny (probably due to different
	version of gtk and this should probably be considered as wxWidgets bug,
	btw) there is an idle event emitted in the middle of our
	DrawFrame::AddDrawPanel method, some time ago idle event handler became
	responsible for destroying notebook widget when there is only one tab in it - 
	I don't remeber now, why I had to delay notebook destruction
	till idle event, but probably to workaround another wxWidgets bug - 
	anyway, when new tab was being added, idle event destoryed notebook that was
	just created to store tabs, thus leading to draw3 crash
2010-05-19	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* parcook/iecdmn.cc: fixes
2010-05-17	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* parcook/iecdmn.cc: daemon for queryig enery meters over protocol
	defined in IEC 62056-21, version not yet tested
2010-05-13	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>

2010-05-11	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* INSTALL.Window: small addition
	* resources/documentation/new/Makefile.am: added @srcdir@ to dmn2sgml.py invocation
        * INSTALL.Windows: infomation on cross-compilation of FTGL and
	libfreetype added

	* libSzarp2: lua parser split into two files - otherwise mingw chokes and dies on it
	* libSzarp2: some minor compilation fixes
	* winsetup.sh: more dlls added
	* wx/draw3: xyz graphs work under msw, focus fixes - under
	msw, moving focus in focus event, makes control that received
	the event completly inactive
2010-05-07	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* utils/proves_server/*: added time of last available probe to
	response for GET request.
2010-05-04	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* resources/, debian/: prober added to debian packages and init
	scripts.

	* utils/probes_server/szbcache.py: optimization in NO_DATA writing.
	* utils/probes_server/szbcache.py: fixes in data reading.
2010-05-04	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3: added triangulation to 3D graphs, it is a
	slight adaptation of Fortune's sweep algorithm code
	* NEWS*: update
2010-05-01	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* utils/probes_server/*: probes_server sometimes works.
	* utils/probes_server/csv_client.py: extrszb-like client for
	probes_server.
	* .gitignore: more git-ignored files.
2010-04-30	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* resources/version.info: readded to packages
	* wx/draw3: help for XYZ graphs
2010-04-28	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* parcook/mbdmn.cc: read-tiemeout option added, chars-delay renamed to out-intra-character-delay

	of invdividual chars in message (needs testing)
2010-04-27	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3: 3D graphs - 3D graphs print support (printouts are quite ugly so far, though)
	* wx/draw3: added commented out code for multisampling of 3D graphs (requires patched version
	of wxWidgets), commented out because none of drivers for video cards I have, supports
	multisampling, so I have no way of testing 
2010-04-27	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* ipk.sgml: description of doc:doc subelement in param element.
2010-04-25	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3/xyzgraph.cpp: axes and units painted, fix in left-right keyboard movement
2010-04-24	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3/GUI/*: fixes in 'Notifications' window - added surrounding
	wxPanel so keyboard navigation works, added spaces around widgets.
2010-04-23	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3: 3d graph colors fix, cubes instead of sqaures for single points,
	better catching of mouse clicks
	* libSzarp2/szbase: configurable size of in-memory cache
2010-04-18	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3/xyzgraph.cpp: 3D graphs: fix in points
	selection with mouse, graph can be rotated by mouse movement
	/right button should be pressed for that/, mouse wheel
	zooms graph in/out, keyboard controlled rotation affects
	field of view and not graph itself
2010-04-17	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/common/Makefile.am: version.h generated from
	/version (or current_tag in packages build), 
	* debian/packs.files: version.info removed from
	list of szarp-base files' list
2010-04-16	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* debian/rules: packages version taken from current_tag file
	(that is automatically generated)
	* libSzarp2/szbase/lua_parser.cc: fix in recognizing
	'elseif' as keyword
2010-04-15	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* README, INSTALL, INSTALL.Windows: docs update.
	* AUTHORS: update.
2010-04-14	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* ChangeLog: testing e-mail.
	* Makefile.am, debian/rules: fetching version info from version file.
	* version: conversion to git; git does not use numeric revision
	numbers, so SZARP version numbers are not incremented automatically
	after each commit, you need to set it manually in version file.
	* debian/*: removed szarp-sss and szarp-doc-pdf-chrno packages, loosen
	some package dependencies, removed '-g' from compiler flags.
	* script/*: removed obsolete sss bases/users synchronization
	mechanism.
	* wx/sync/ssconfd/ssconf.py: we're not using /opt/szarp/.../sss_bases
	file anymore.
2010-04-14	Darek Marcinkiewcz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3/GUI/resources.xrc: XYZ graph menu item readded

	cursor to 3D graph added, but for now XYZ graphs are disabled
2010-04-09	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* parcook/ddedmnc.cc: added optional dde:prec attribute for
	parameters.
	* utils/ddeproxy/ddeproxy.py: attempt to catch server exceptions.
2010-04-07	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* parcook/*, ipk.sgml: documentation of mbusdmn and wlkdmn moved to
	daemons source code.

	* wx/setter: simple wxPython client for setdmn.
	* parcook/setdmn.cc: daemon working.
	* parcook/mbdmn.cc: parsing of 'tcp-allowed' attribute instead of
	incorrect 'allowed_ip'.
	* libSzarp2/ipk/tparam.cc: correct rounding when converting double to
	short int in TParam::ToIPCValue() method.
2010-04-06	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* libSzarp2: added proper termination of 'configuration
	watcher' thread, introducing comments into new code part I:
	comments for Szbase class
	* wx/draw3: readded calculation of margins on time graph,
	proper removal of wxAuiNotebook when last but one tab is closed		
	- bugs that resulted from code refactoring...
	some progress on 3D graphs	
2010-04-02	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* script/dmn2sgml.py: script for generating SGML documentation from
	line daemons source code files.
	* parcook/README: description of line daemons documentation format.
	* parcook/setdmn.cc: daemon for setting parameters from network
	client, work in progress.
	* parcook/*: added documentation for some daemons.
	* resources/documentation/new/Makefile.am, ipk.sgml: inclusion of line
	daemons documentation.
	* utils/*: fixes in modem pooling utilities, modem_pooler.sh has now
	new option '-m' (like 'manual') that turns verbose mode and ignores
	'nocall' file.
	* Makefile.am: doxy target made .PHONY, so it is regenerated on every
	run.
	* Doxyfile: JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF enabled to get brief description of
	classes.
2010-04-01	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw/*: fixed compilation with lua parameters optimiser disabled.
	* wx/viszio/Makefile.am: typo fix.
	* configure.in: fixed parsing of --enable-lua-param-optimiser option.
	* parcook/ddedmn.cc: less strict parsing of dde return strings.
	* parcook/mbdmn.cc: fix in modbus 0x04 function name, fixes in
	configuration example.
2010-03-31	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase/loptdatablock.cc: when deciding
	if a block should be refreshed, we check for change 
	of meaner last update time in any of buffers referred 
	by this block, so far we checked only the block's
	parent buffer, what is not sufficient in case 
	of formulas that take data from multiple configurations
	* libSzarp2/szbase/loptdatablock.cc: one more cache fix...
	* libSzarp2/szbase/loptdatablock.cc: some values
	that should not yet be cached were wrongly classified
	as cacheable (this bug only affected lua optimized
	paramters)
	* wx/draw3: small new feature 'edit as new defined' - 
	when this option is choosen current set is 
	converted to user defined set and dialog for
	editing this newly cereated set pops up
2010-03-30	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3: documentation link defaults to http://szarp.com
	* wx/draw3: when 'parameter documentation' is
	clicked on user defined param, we simply show
	this parameter formula instead of directing
	user to nonexistent documentation on the web;
	one corner case bug fixed (found by observing how draw3
	behaves when database thread is shut down and user starts
	sitching sets and average types); some more of common
	drawing code moved to graphsutils.cpp
2010-03-29	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* wx/draw3: draw3 periodically checks if version
	that is running is older that the one installed
	on a computer, if the installed version is newer,
	user is asked to restart draw3
2010-03-29	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase: lua parser fixes, optimized params
	are now properly updated with configuration reload,
	added better debug info in params optimizer,
	when user param is modfied its cache is cleared
	* wx/draw3: 'import set' is always active 
2010-03-26	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@newterm.pl>
	* wx/draw3: new feature: import/export of user sets
2010-03-25	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw/*: more focus fixes, added icon for X/Y Graph dialog,
	removed double menu entry in X/Y Graph dialog.
2010-03-24	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw/selset.*: fixed bug with incorrect focus after mouse leaving
	SelectSetWidget.
2010-03-22	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* utils/szredialer: retrying initialization of modem. 
2010-03-17      Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/viszio: viszio is removed from taskbar (Linux), default 
	configuration is created when viszio is started without any 
	parameters
2010-03-17      Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* resources/documentation/new/viszio: viszio documentation 
	update
2010-03-17      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase/loptdatablock.{c.h}: micro optimization - 
	statments have now separate internal represenation from
	expressions, it should save a little time cause we don't have
	to push dummy value onto stack at the end of statement execution
2010-03-16      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* debian/control: libboost1.42-all-dev added to build
	depends
	* debian/control: boost1.42 set as only boost version
	in build depends	
	* debian/control: boost1.42 added to build depends as
	another alternative
	* debian: added --enable-lua-optimizer (just
	for this one build), building unstable
	* libSzarp2: lua param optimiser - blocks 
	are properly refreshed
	* libSzarp2: lua param optimiser - more fixes
	* libSzarp2: lua param optimiser: support for
	in_season function added, optimized parameters
	may now refer to any moment in time, some bug fixes
2010-03-15      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* parcook/parcook.cc: small simplification
2010-03-14      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* parcook/parcook.cc: lsw and msw parts of combined 
	params are glued together while average values
	are calculated, this prevents nasty effects of rounding
	errors on msw; small bug in allocating memory for
	daemons' arguments removed
2010-03-13      Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* howto.sgml: added info about ICON 225 gprs modem configuration.
2010-03-12      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* parcook/dlmsdmn.cc: IEC starting protocol connection
	speed is now configurable
2010-03-11      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2/execute.cc: do exit() in child process
	if execv fails, prevents execdmn from forking
	ad infinitum when path argument does not point
	to valid executable
2010-03-10      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase: some progress in lua param optimizer,
	a couple of simple params do work
2010-03-09      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@daliaterm.pl>
	* parcook/mbdmn.cc: one more serial mode adjustment to comply
	with modbus rtu spec - while reading frame daemon decides that
	whole frame was received when no characters arrives for 1.5 *
	{time of trasmition of one byte} - (actually it waits
	twice the time given above, just to be on safe side) previous time
	- 2 seconds - turned out to be too long, because some masters query us
	with frequency equal or greater than that
	* parcook/mbdmn.cc: serial mode fixes - stop_timer was called when
	timer was already stopped, m_timer_started flag was not
	set to true upon timer start
2010-03-08      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@daliaterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2: optimizer incorporated into szbase, 
	now what's left is to make it work... note: optimizer is
	not compiled by default so current szarp codebase can
	still be considered stable
2010-03-06      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@daliaterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2: optimizer code typed in, but it is
	not incorporated into szbase code yet
2010-03-04      Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* debian/changelog: building stable.
	* meaner3/utils/szbwriter.cc: removed failing check for 'base_format'
	parameter from szarp.cfg.
2010-03-03      Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* parcook/mbdmn.cc: added forgotten return from function after
	rejecting connecting client's address.
2010-03-03      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@daliaterm.pl>
	* meaner3: usage of "C" locale in boost::wpath enforced -
	may prevent program termination when started with strange/
	invalid LC_ variables values
2010-03-03      Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* parcook/mbdmn.cc: removed "dereferencing type-punned pointer ..."
	warning, replaced '< 0' with '== -1' on checking return values from
	various system functions.
2010-03-03      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@daliaterm.pl>
	* wx/sync: fix for windows, for reasons I won't be
	investigating now:
	char *c;
	asprintf(&c, "%.4ld%.2ld.szb", year, month)
	produces garbage, wheras:
	char c[11];
	sprintf(c, "%.4ld%.2ld.szb", year, month) 
	works fine
	asprintf uses vsnprintf internally and initial
	buffer is large enough so we don't do any reallocations
	- it should just work...
2010-03-02      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@daliaterm.pl>
	* parcook/tensdmn.cc: added support for reading flow values
	* wx/draw3: two fixes: draws enabling/disabling was reported
	twice to 'observers', first notification was happening when
	controller was in inconsistent state what might result in assert
	upon set change; program does not crash when configuration is reloaded
	and new version of configuration has currently selected set
	renamed/removed
2010-03-01      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@daliaterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase: beginnigns of optimized params 'execution engine'
2010-03-01      Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* resources/documentation/new/: 2 screenshots replaced because NSIS
	mysteriously fails on them.
2010-03-01      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@daliaterm.pl>
	* configure.in: lua parser is built optionally
2010-02-28      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@daliaterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2/Makefile.am: linking fix for test app
	* libSzarp2: parser coverted to unicode
2010-02-27      Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/raporter3/: only single parameter from given report can be selected, 
	selected parameter is rememberd and it is correctly displayed after 
	fetching operation
2010-02-27      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@daliaterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2: lua parser added do built, small app
	for parser testing added
2010-02-26      Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@daliaterm.pl>
	* wx/sync: small fixes, seems to work
	* wx/sync: now, when szbase_stamp is always updated if historical
	data, no matter how 'fresh', is changed, we can speed up
	synchronization - instead of exchanging rsync hashes for szbase files,
	we just send a part of file that contains data not yet present
	on a client - code not tested, I just commit it to make testing 
	a little bit easier for me
2010-02-26      Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* ipk.sgml: description of params element attributes; added
	description of formulas documentations (extra:doc subelements of define
	elements).
	* resources/dtd/ipk-params.rng: added description of
	documentation_base_url attribute of params element.
2010-02-25      Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/raporter3/: last two changes are temporarly rejected, because some problems
	appears when server configuration is changed
2010-02-25      Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/raporter3/: some bugs fixed, refreshment works correctly 
	for predefined raports and for templates

	* wx/raporter3/: list refreshing improvement
2010-02-23      Darek Marcinkiewcz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/draw3: some more printing improvements
2010-02-22      Darek Marcinkiewcz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/libSzarp2/szbase/lua: lua parser, initial version, not hooked
	into build yet, should allow us to do transformation/optimization 
	of not too complex lua parameters
	* wx/draw3/cfgmgr.h: unused method removed
	* wx/draw3/: if all graphs of user defined set come from the
	same configuration, the configuration name in printed instead of 
	"user defined set", size of fonts is dynamically adjusted
	so that time range string and draw names at the bottom
	half of the printing fit page size
2010-02-20      Darek Marcinkiewcz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/draw3: blocked draws objects were not unblocked
	upon draws' set switch, that might rise assert in 
	some usage scenarios
2010-02-19	Krzysztof Galazka <kg@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* debian/control: no reason for conflict with szarp-daemons in
	szarp-viewer package
2010-02-18      Darek Marcinkiewcz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase: improved checking for lua params execution erros
	* wx/draw3: fix in switching number of displayed points

	* wx/viszio/*: desktop switching is available, multifile 
	configuration is implemented
2010-02-05      Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/common/serverdlg.*: server name is written to default 
	configuration file, but it can be turned off, it is needed by viszio
	where multiconfiguration is implemented
2010-02-05	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2/linedmn/ppset: switching from overlapped
	to synchronous serial port I/O on msw
2010-02-04      Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* szast: szast can now fetch reports and settings
	from regulators, user can save retrived data to file
2010-02-02      Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* parcook/parcook.cc: fix in line daemons command line.
	* utils/ddeproxy/*: renamed ddespy along with setup file for py2exe.
2010-02-01      Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* resources/documentation/new/Makefile.am: fix in sed replace
	expresion.
2010-01-28      Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/viszio/Makefile.am: correct include dirs for libwnck, current
	library version needs WNCK_I_KNOW_THIS_IS_UNSTABLE defined.
	* wx/Makefile.am: conditional including viszio subdirectory.
	* configure.in: libwnck uses pkg-config; libwnck is disabled by
	default, use '--with-wnck' to enable it.
2010-01-28      Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/draw3: info widget's min/avg/max values are properly updated when 
	switching from/to double cursor mode, dialog for param editing when 
	displayed shows edited parameter type correctly
2010-01-25      Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* parcook/mbtcpdmn.cc: small fix in connection errors logging.
2010-01-25      Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/common/serverdlg.*: ipk loading is done in a separate 
	thread - refreshing of a progress dialog works well
2010-01-21      Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/viszio: fetchig parameters has been corrected, it should work 
	now, antyaliasing menu has been added, moving transparent frame is 
	more flexible (some problems with GTK has been founded),  
	GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_DOCK flag has been used but it makes impossible 
	to put transparent frame on taskbar now
	* resources/wx/icons: icons for viszio has been added

	params.xml was modified and users clicks 'reload configuration',
	drawdefinable parames with 'N' operator do not go into the future
	* wx/draw3: SelDrawWidget item is greyed out when there is no
	data for given param
2010-01-18	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* parcook/ddedmn.cc: mutliple fixes, support for fetching values from
	InTouch through new ddespy.py, info about configuration.
	* utils/ddespy.py: new version of DDE Proxy with configurable DDE
	application name, persistent connection to DDE Server and disabled
	resolving of client address.
2010-01-17	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* parcook/execdmn: fixed commands running.
2010-01-16	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/draw3: program sometimes crashed when windows
	with values ratio was closed, fixed
	* libSzarp2: next_same_param and prev_same_param members from
	BlockLockator restored, it turns out there are neccessary
	* meaner3/utils/szbmod.cc: it is now possible to modify more
	than one parameter in one formula, useful for e.g. parameters
	values' swapping
2010-01-16	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* libSzarp/daemon.cc: go_daemon() returns error if setsid() failed,
	formatting and comments fixes.

	'sh -c'.
2010-01-15      Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* parcook/mbdmn.cc: it is now possible to set 
	msw/lsw registers order for individual params
2010-01-14      Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* parcook/mbdmn.cc: added support for read input registers command,
	fixes
2010-01-14      Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* configure.in, wx/viszio/Makefile.am: viszio is configured to 
	link against libwnck and glib libraries (to move frames between 
	workspaces)
2010-01-13	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* documentation/new/common/wdrozenia.sgml: new implementations.
2010-01-13	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/draw3: tabs naming fix, some commented out code removed
2010-01-12	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* configure.in, debian/control: removed unnecessary linking and
	dependency on libXp library.
2010-01-11	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* meaner3/utils/szbmod: tool even cooler than szbndremover ;)
	Szbmod allows for modification of historical data through
	lua formulas. Szbmod takes a lua formula, period of time and a param
	to be modified. Then for each database probe from given time period
	it runs the formula much in the same way as it is done with drawdefinable
	params. Values returned from the formula are then stored in database.
	For example if program is run with following params:
	szbmod -fformula -Dprefix=xxxx -s'2007-01-01 00:00' \
	-e'2009-12-30 00:00' "Sieæ:Sterownik:Temperatura zewnêtrzna"
	and contents of file formula is like that:
	v = 2 * p("xxxx:Sieæ:Sterownik:Temperatura zewnêtrzna", t, pt)
	then for given period values of "Sieæ:Sterownik:Temperatura zewnêtrzna" will be doubled.
	Of course these formulas has access to the same stuff that drawdefinable
	formulas have - they can refer to values of other params coming from
	any point in time.
	* wx/libSzarp2/szbase: quite significant improvement of cache mechanism
	efficiency, more mutexes removed, some variables/class attributes renamed
	to comply with convention used throughout szbase code, these chagnes
	has also some other conseqences: cache now is saved upon clean close
	of draw3 app, so if you want to enjoy speed of cache, you should
	close draw3 cleany (I'll fix that); szbase code assumes that
	szbase_stamp is updated whenever anything in historical data changes,
	even if a change touches data that are younger then two months
2010-01-08	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* menaer3/tprober.*: forgotten commit.
	* meaner3/prober.*: prober - daemon for writing 10-seconds data probes
	to disk, highly experimental ;-); most of code is shared with meaner3, 
	data format is identical to szbase, except for fact that there's one 
	probe for each 10 seconds, not 10 minutes; each file (default suffix
	*.szc) contains data for one month, about 0,5 MB per parameter per
	month; data is written to disk in chunks of 6 elements every minute or
	at program termination; output directory is read from szarp.cfg -
	'cachedir' value from 'prober' section.
	* meaner3/*: meaner3 using new twriter class, removed reading of some
	unnecessary config variables (eg. 'base_format'), small fixes.
	* meaner3/twriter.*: common base class for meaner3 and prober daemons.
	* libSzarp2/szbase/*: support for other probe lengths in
	szb_probeind(), support for other filename suffix in
	szb_createfilename_ne().
	* libSzarp2/include/sumator.h: template of simple 'sumator' class - it
	occured I don't really need it, but it's a nice template, so I decided
	to commit it anyway...
	* resources/SZARP_IN_CFG_TEMPLATE: added default configuration for
	prober.
	* wx/common/aboutdlg.cc: 'Ok' button set as default so it gets
	keyboard focus.
2010-01-08      Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/viszio: font for transparent window with own, "not-antialiasing" 
	implementation, with minimal impact of system font settings
2010-01-07	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* *.sgml: setting svn:keywords properties for SGML documentation files.
2010-01-06	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* raporter.sgml: completed Raporter documentation, screenshots added.
	* wx/scc/*: technical support tunnel dialog changed so user has to

2010-01-01	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/common: msw compilation fix

2009-12-31      Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/visio->wx/viszio: name of the application has been changed,

	no data holes in szbase
2009-12-23	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3: autorefresh reenabled, start time is choosen
	correctly when moving in left direction in periods WEEK and DAY
	* libSzarp2/szbase: definable blocks are stored into cache when
	they are removed (this includes termination of draw3), separate
	thread that used to do this deleted: first round of - in my 
	opinion unnecessary - locking removal from szbase
2009-12-23	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3: a few more bugs fixed: crash upon draws' set change
	after configuration reload; incorrect behaviour when '[' or ']'
	keys are pressed; handling of configuration reload moved from 
	DrawPanel to DrawsController; draw panel is now properly
	resized after last but one tab is closed
2009-12-22	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3: pointer to parent window added for all wxMessageBox()
	invocations, so message boxes get proper application icon; error 
	icons added for some dialogs.

	removed.

	* wx/draw3: "edit set" and "remove set" menu items are properly
	enabled/disabled when sets are changed between regular and
	user defined sets
	* wx/draw3: now we have one menubar per farme (previously each
	tab has its own menubar) - fixes problem with keyboard shortcuts
	originating from menu, fixed data refreshing, fixed cursor
	positioning upon switch to other draw that has no data within
	current view (silly omission on my part)
2009-12-22	Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/common/serverdlg.cpp: dialog works for given configuration 
	or for default one "ServerDlg". It is needed by visio where many 
	configurations can be chosen.
2009-12-21	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3: simplification of code parts that were
	most convoluted, unfortunately these changes affect nearly
	everything, and although I have tested every feature there
	is still a possiblity that in some cases program behaves
	incorretcly, so this version shouldn't be pushed to 
	production use for some time yet
2009-12-18	Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/common/serverdlg.cpp: wxConfig flush operation has been added

	* wx/visio/Makefile.am: removed installation of visio's localized
	strings, there are no locales for visio yet
2009-12-12	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* howto.sgml: updated section about GRPS modems - configuration for
	Debian, forcing GPRS/UMTS.
2009-12-10	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/draw3/infowdg.cpp: on some displays, black text is poorly
	visible on blue background, so we make background color for info
	widget a little lighter. 
	* raporter.sgml: typo fix.
	* ipk.sgml: 'M' function description.
	* parcook/parcook.cc: new 'M' function for defined parameters -
	simmetric to 'm' function.
2009-12-10	Adam Smyk <asmyk@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* wx/visio: new application for parameters visualisation 
	has been added (it is under construction)
2009-12-10	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* parcook/mbdmn.cc: even more fixes for serial mode

	* parcook/mbtcpdmn.cc: fix is generation of write
	multiple registers command in client mode
2009-12-07	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* parcook/mbdmn.cc: modbus daemon, supporting tcp/rtu 
	& slave/master mode, not tested yet, may still lack some
	features of previous daemons
2009-12-02	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* utils/nagios/sn-fam.py: fix - daemon doest not fail when
	configuration is not a proper XML file.
	* libSzarp2/ipk/tszarpconfig.cc: removed warning about parameter's 
	description length in report.
2009-12-02	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* resources/regulators: more controllers' definitons for szast.
2009-12-01	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>

	silly bug.
2009-11-26	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@dalkiaterm.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase/definabledatablock.cc: fixed
	typo in checking for no data values in parameters
	for '$' drawdefinable function
	* wx/draw3: user may now set margins, page size and
	orientation of printouts, only setting of margins was tested
	- it is probably the only importat fature form this
	commit
	* libSzarp/mbrtu.cc: check size of received frame - 
	so far daemon blindly assumed that receive buffer
	contains a properly formatted frame, what does
	not have to be the case in some circumstances.
2009-11-25	Pawel Palucha  <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/*: scc, ssc and draw3 use szSingleInstanceChecker instead of
	wxSingleInstanceChecker.
	* wx/common/singleinstance.*: modified implementation of
	wxSingleInstanceChecker, that checks also for executable name of
	process holding lock. It fixes possible errors with stale lock file
	and another process with the pid from lock file running.
	* wx/confedit/cframe.cc: fixed segfault when moving last draws' set
	down; correct minimum window size set.
2009-11-25	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@praterm.com.pl>
	* libSzarp2/szbase/realdatablock.cc: removed restriction that
	block cannot come from the future (understood as starting
	later than lastest value of meaner status parameter)
2009-11-24	Pawel Palucha  <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/confedit/dlistctrl.cc: fixes in handling min/max attributes:

	serial port over TCP - implementation of RFC2217 (Telnet Com Port Control
	Option). Fairly complete but completly untested.

	* ipk/pics/ipkedit1.png: screenshot from current version.
	* ipk.sgml: updated section about IPK Editor.
	* wx/confedit/*: IPK Editor updated - draws' colors and min/max ranges
	can be changed; order/prior attributes are always recalculated - in
	previous version you had to manually run recalculation from menu to
	get correct draws order; various fixes.
	* wx/raporter3/rap.cc: fixed adding '--help' option.
	* wx/raporter3/pl/raporter3.po: .po file fix.
	* wx/draw3/cfgmgr.cc: draw3 uses DrawDefaultColors now..
	* wx/common/dcolors.*: class for querying about default draws colors.
2009-11-16	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/raporter/*: user report templates are now saved automaticaly and
	are available directly from menu - this is more compliant with draw3
	behaviour; lots of other small fixes and improvements, code review.
	* wx/common/fetchparams.cc: printing debug info removed.
	* wx/common/aboutdlg.cpp: "About" dialog size changed - to many
	authors ;-)
	* wx/common/serverdlg.cpp: printing debug info removed.
	* wx/common/parlist.cpp: fixed getting configuration title from loaded
	XML file.

	* parcook/ddedmn.cc: it compiles now, but I doubt it works ;-)
2009-11-17	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@praterm.pl>
	* wx/scc/Makefile.am: we no longer install /etc/X11/Xsession.d/79scc
	and /etc/X11/xprofile files - may help for scc instances that don't
	want to die with their X session.
2009-11-16	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* resources/documentation/new/*: Bilgoraj added to references list.
2009-11-13	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@praterm.pl>
	* wx/ddedmn.cc: items no longer have to be numbers, but they still
	must be numbers in case of params of type float and short_float (because
	then we assume that values of these params are stored in two consecutive 
	items) - situation similar to modbus registers
	* wx/ddedmn.cc: added option for speciyfing how often
	driver should ask ddespy for values
2009-11-12	Adam Smyk <asmyk@praterm.pl>
	* INSTALL.wxWidgets: small correction
2009-11-11	Darek Marcinkiewicz <darek@praterm.pl>
	* /: SZARP once again compiles under Ubuntu, 'Karmic Koala' this time.
	Some of the changes are strange though - e.g. index 
	function from libc (the one that looks for a character in a string)
	takes as an argument char* whereas under Debian it is const char*.
	Debian version makes much more sense...
2009-11-07	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/raporter3/rap.cc: setting default application icon.
	* wx/raporter3/raporter.h: removed printing of debug info.

	allow to create empty report or report without title - fixes possible
	segfault when registering empty report.
	* wx/common/parselect.cpp: fix in widgets arrangement; if draw name is
	empty, widget correctly uses last part of full parameter name.
	* wx/common/serverdlg.cpp: server dialogs use default application
	icon.
2009-11-06	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>

	parameter list.

2009-11-05	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@praterm.pl>
	* wx/common: two bugs in help system fixed: searching
	does not cause an application to crash; when help
	is opened from within modal dialog, the help window
	is no longer frozen and incative. The fix was to
	substitute existing wxhtml help implementation with
	the one found 'on the internet'. The implementation
	we have now uses wxWidgets' license and is written
	by main wxWidgets contributor, so we should be fine ;)
2009-11-04	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* wx/wxhelp/whapp.cpp: fixed list of help books.
	* script/nsis/common.nsi: fixed launching szau from Startup folder.

	files.
2009-11-02	Darek Marcinkiewicz <reksio@praterm.pl>

	to red for debug purposes, fixed.
2009-10-31	
	* /: small fixes here are there to make SZARP compile
	with latest mingw 
	* libSzarp2/szbase: extractor3 under msw works again
	- msw still used code specific for boost1.34 since
	the bug
	* wx/draw3: help under msw works, antialiased graphs work
	under linux and msw and are now default graphs drawing
	method	
2009-10-31	Pawel Palucha <pawel@praterm.com.pl>
	* debian/pack.files: fix in icons list.
	* debian/control: maintainer name format fix.
	* debian/*: lintian bug 'not-using-po-debconf' fixed - templates
