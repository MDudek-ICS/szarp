This files briefly describes installation of SZARP software. The simplest way
of instalation for end-users it to user Debian packages.
SZARP is known to compile and run on Debian (both 32 and 64-bits), Ubuntu 
(tested some times ago and with minor problems) and Moxa ARM platform (only
server side). Some clients applications are cross-compiled for Windows.
All the development and testing is done on Debian, so you can run into some 
problems with other distributions. 

See also INSTALL.ARM and INSTALL.Windows for information about ARM and Windows
platforms.

1. Instalation from source.

SZARP uses autotools, but is deployed without configure scripts, so you need
automake, autoconf, libtool and pkg-config. The commands to build SZARP are:

# ./autogen.sh

This is invocation ot automake and autoconf, is should run without any error 
messages. In case of errors, check if you have new versions of automake, autoconf,
libtool and pkg-config installed.

# ./configure

This is invocation of configure scipts. There are many options available, see

# ./conifgure --help

Configuration for Windows is described in INSTALL.Windows. There are 
'--with-XXX' and '--without-XXX' options available to turn on/off optional 
libraries. For example, to get server-only software (and get short compile time),
you can use '--without-x'.

By default all optional libraries are turned on. If some library is not found,
SZARP is configured without this library. At the end of configure run, there's
a report generated with information what libraries where found. To get full
funcionality, you must have all libraries. Be aware, that currently there are 
no Debian packages for wx 2.8 - you can use packages available at 
http://www.szarp.com.pl/debian.

If you plan to debug programs, you should change compilator options. By default
'-g' is used, but -O2 (optimization) fulls debugger. To get debugger-friendly
code type this before ./configure:

# export CFLAGS="-g"
# export CXXFLAGS="-g"

Now:

# make

This should compile everything. If there are errors, you have found a bug. But
if you're not using Debian etch/unstable, there's a little chance that we will 
help you with this. Patches are welcome if they not brake Debian ;-)

# make doc

This creates html documentation. You need lot's of Docbook stuff installed for
this to work - ./configure should warn you about missing programs.

Now you can become root and type:

# make install

Default instalation directory is /opt/szarp. You can install SZARP under other 
directory by using

# make DESTDIR=/tmp install

or by passing '--prefix' argument to ./configure.

To install programs without debugger information (smaller, faster binaries
but debugging not possible), you can use:

# make install-strip

To clean everything use:

# make clean

To get rid also of files generated by autotools, use:

# make maintainer-clean

or

# make cleanconfig

(old form from SZARP 2.1 version).


2. Installation from Debian packages.

This is the simplest and best supported method of instalation.
Add following line to /etc/apt/sources.list:

deb http://www.szarp.com.pl/debian unstable main

Then run: 

# apt-get update

and one of the following:

# apt-get install szarp-server
# apt-get install szarp-terminal
# apt-get install szarp-viewer
